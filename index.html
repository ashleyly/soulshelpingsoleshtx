								<h4 id = "update">	9/1/17 UPDATE: After Hurricane Harvey, many families lost their homes and all their belongings, including clothing and shoes, due to the high flood waters. Living in Houston, a place that was significantly impacted by Harveyâ€™s rain, we saw firsthand how many people, including friends and acquaintances, were devastated by the enormity of destruction. Because of this devastation, we have decided to give back to our community by donating many of the shoes that we have collected to children and local Houstonians in need. So far, we have donated 318 shoes to local shelters, including the George R. Brown Convention Center, as well as to individual families in need.</h4>
								<h4 id = "update">	Although we plan to resume collecting shoes for children in Costa Rica in the future, right now, our main focus will be to help residents of Houston rebuild and return to normal life. If you are in need of sneakers or shoes or know someone who is in need of sneakers, please contact us at soulshelpingsoleshtx@gmail.com with the number of shoes you need, shoe sizes, and a drop off location. In addition, if you would like to donate shoes to families impacted by Hurricane Harvey, please email us at soulshelpingsoleshtx@gmail.com, and we can either pick up shoes from your front porch or arrange for them to be dropped off. Thank you for your support!</h4>

								</header>
								<p>You can make a difference! By donating one pair of shoes, you are allowing one child to attend school or learn to play a sport. Even though Costa Rica is an amazing travel destination, many children and families who live there don't have enough money to buy shoes. With your help, we can give the children of Costa Rica hope one step at a time.</p>
