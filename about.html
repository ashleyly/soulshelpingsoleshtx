							<h4><a href = "http://www.soulshelpingsoles.org/"><b>Souls Helping Soles</b></a> is a non-profit organization in the U.S. and Costa Rica that collects and donates shoes to children in Costa Rica. Founded by Lisa Garrett, Souls Helping Soles helps give children hope one step at a time.</h4>
							<h4><b><img src="justlexi.jpg" id = "headshots">Lexi Guo</b> is 13 years old and attends the Annunciation Orthodox School in Houston, Texas. She has been involved with collecting shoes for the children of Costa Rica since she was in the third grade when she helped her Aunt Cindy, who was involved in the same organization, gather shoes.  At that time, Aunt Cindy was bravely battling Stage IV lung cancer, but sadly, she later passed away at age 39. Lexi’s commitment to this project was further inspired by her grandmother, who was only able to finish middle school, because her parents could not afford to buy her shoes to walk to school in rural Taiwan. Motivated by her aunt’s dedication and her grandmother’s hardship, Lexi is determined to help the children of Costa Rica. Shoes in Costa Rica are a luxury for many families, and, without shoes, Costa Rican children are unable to go to school or play sports. In her free time, Lexi enjoys diving, baking, and socializing with friends and family. If you have any questions for Lexi or would like to donate shoes, please contact Lexi at soulshelpingsoleshtx@gmail.com.</h4>
							<h4><b><img src="justashley.jpg" id = "headshots2">Ashley Yen</b> is 13 years old and currently attends St. John's School in Houston, Texas. In her free time, Ashley enjoys playing golf, reading, and spending time with friends and family. Through the inspiration of her friend, Lexi, and touched by Lexi's Aunt Cindy's contributions and efforts to the Souls Helping Soles Organization, Ashley was motivated to create a website to raise awareness about the lack of shoes in Costa Rica. She believes that if everyone donates a pair of shoes, there will be few or even no children in Costa Rica that are unable to participate in daily activities or attend school. If you have any questions for Ashley or would like to donate shoes, please contact Ashley at soulshelpingsoleshtx@gmail.com.</h4>
							<h4><b>Lexi and Ashley</b> have been close friends since age 3 when they met at daycare. They both love hanging out together, experimenting with art projects, and supporting each other's endeavors, like collecting shoes for Souls Helping Soles.</h4>
